# Gravline-Zero
The source code to my video game Gravline: Zero

Gravline: Zero is a project I dedicated myself to in the scope of about a month or two learning how to use pygame and it offered a 
great way to tell a story as well.  The game combines various RPG, visual novels and SHUMP genres in a unique take on the genres.
The scifi story also ties into the VayneLine series of stories I have written.
